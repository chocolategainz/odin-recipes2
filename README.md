# odin-recipes2

This current project entails using HTML to create a simple website displaying three recipes for baking. The three dishes include Bramley apple pie, Scones, and Victoria sponge cake. These were particularly chosen because I used to enjoy baking these desserts as a child with my Father and Mother. The skills used to design this website involve unordered & ordered listing, image implementing, underlined text, size variation of text and images, and lastly the use of absolute links.
